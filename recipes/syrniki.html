  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 1&frasl;4 pounds quark cheese</li>
    <li>2&frasl;3 cup all-purpose-flour, sifted</li>
    <li>1&frasl;4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1&frasl;4 cup raisins, or to taste &lpar;Optional&rpar;</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>1&frasl;2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1&frasl;4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 pinches salt</li>
    <li>1&frasl;4 cup all-purose-flour, or as needed</li>
    <li>1&frasl;4 cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Strain or process quark cheese through a sieve or 
      meat grinder to achieve a powdery consistency. Mix 
      quark cheese, 2/3 cup flour, sugar, raisins, eggs, 
      baking soda, vanilla extract, and salt together in a 
      bowl until batter is well mixed.
    </li>

    <li>
      Pour 1/4 cup flour into a small bowl.
    </li>

    <li>
      Roll batter, about 2 tablespoons per serving, into a 
      ball and roll in flour until coated. Flatten each 
      ball into a 2-inch patty, squaring off the edges.
    </li>

    <li>
      Heat about 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over 
      medium-low heat. Fry patties, working in batches, in 
      the hot oil until dark brown and a shell has formed, 
      3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper 
      towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining oil and 
      patties.
    </li>
  </ol>
