  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of 
    wide, flat pasta sheets alternating with rich meat 
    sauce, creamy b√©chamel sauce, and various cheeses like 
    ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan.
    It's a hearty and comforting meal, often baked until 
    bubbly and golden brown.

    <li>1 &lpar;16 ounce&rpar; package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Combine pork and ground beef in a large, 
      deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and 
      stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 
      minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, 
      about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon
      fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano,
      and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer,
      stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      While the sauce is simmering, bring a pot
      of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
      noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
      until tender yet firm to bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
      Drain and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven
      to 375 degrees F &lpar;190 degrees C&rpar;.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs,
      remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt,
      and pepper in a large bowl until combined.
    </li>
    <li>
      Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of
      sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking
      dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of
      noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with
      1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the
      remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella
      cheese. Repeat layers once more using the
      remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce,
      and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with
      aluminum foil.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40
      minutes. Remove the foil and bake until 
      cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove from the oven and let stand for
      10 minutes before cutting and serving.
